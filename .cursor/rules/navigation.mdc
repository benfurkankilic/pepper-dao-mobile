description: Navigation and routing patterns using expo-router
globs: **/app/**/*.tsx
---

- Use expo-router for all routing and navigation following the file-based routing convention
- Organize routes using the app directory structure (e.g., app/(tabs)/, app/modal.tsx)
- Use layout files (_layout.tsx) to configure navigation structure for stack, tab, and drawer navigators
- Leverage dynamic routes with [param] syntax for parameterized paths (e.g., app/user/[id].tsx)
- Use the Link component from expo-router for type-safe navigation between screens
- Implement deep linking and universal links using expo-router's built-in support
- Use router.push(), router.replace(), and router.back() for programmatic navigation
- Ensure compatibility with iOS and Android by testing navigation flows on both platforms
- Follow expo-router documentation: https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction/
