## Navigation

- Use `expo-router` for navigation and routing; leverage file-based and dynamic route patterns.
- Organize routes with nested folders and conventions for stacks, tabs, and modals per `expo-router` documentation.
- Support deep linking and universal links via `expo-router` and `expo-linking` configuration.
