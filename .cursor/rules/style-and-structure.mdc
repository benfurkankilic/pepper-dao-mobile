## Code Style and Structure

- Write concise, technical TypeScript using functional and declarative patterns. Avoid classes.
- Prefer iteration and modularization over duplication; extract helpers into small pure functions.
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError, shouldRetry, didSucceed).
- Structure files in this order: exported component → subcomponents → helpers → static content → types.
- Favor named exports for components and utilities.
- Follow Expo's documentation for setup/config: https://docs.expo.dev/
