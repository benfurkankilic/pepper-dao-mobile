## Bitmap/Retro Gaming Style
- Follow a retro gaming/pixel art aesthetic with bold, vibrant colors
- Use pixelated fonts and bitmap-style graphics throughout the app
- Implement chunky borders, sharp corners, and retro UI elements
- Create a nostalgic 8-bit/16-bit gaming experience

## Component Styling
- Use NativeWind (Tailwind CSS for React Native) for all styling
- Apply utility classes via className prop for consistent, maintainable styles
- Implement pixel-perfect borders with bold outlines (border-2, border-4)
- Use box shadows to create depth and 3D effects typical of retro games
- Avoid rounded corners (rounded-none); prefer sharp, rectangular shapes
- Create button states that mimic classic game UI using pressed/active state classes
- Extend tailwind.config.js with custom colors, shadows, and spacing for retro theme

## Layout & Responsiveness
- Use Expo's built-in components for common UI patterns and layouts
- Implement responsive design with Flexbox and Expo's useWindowDimensions for screen size adjustments
- Ensure pixel-perfect alignment and grid-based layouts

## Animations & Interactions
- Leverage react-native-reanimated and react-native-gesture-handler for performant animations
- Use snappy, immediate transitions rather than smooth easing (retro feel)
- Implement subtle pixel-art style animations and transitions
- Add satisfying tactile feedback with haptics for button interactions

## Accessibility
- Ensure high accessibility (a11y) standards using ARIA roles and native accessibility props
- Maintain sufficient contrast ratios despite vibrant color palette
- Support screen readers with proper semantic elements
