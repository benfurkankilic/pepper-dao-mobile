## UI and Styling

- Use Expo/React Native primitives for layout and common patterns (View, Text, Pressable).
- Implement responsive design with Flexbox and `useWindowDimensions`.
- Use styled-components or Tailwind CSS per file; avoid large inline style objects.
- Implement dark mode using `useColorScheme` and design tokens.
- Ensure high accessibility with accessibilityRole/Label/Hint and proper hitSlop.
- Use `react-native-reanimated` and `react-native-gesture-handler` for performant animations and gestures.
