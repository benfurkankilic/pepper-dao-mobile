## Error Handling and Validation

- Validate inputs and responses with Zod.
- Handle errors first: use guard clauses and early returns to avoid deep nesting.
- Avoid unnecessary `else`; prefer if-return patterns.
- Implement global error boundaries to catch unexpected errors.
- Log errors with Sentry (or similar) and `expo-error-reporter` in production.
