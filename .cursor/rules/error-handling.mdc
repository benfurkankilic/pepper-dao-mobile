- Use Zod for runtime validation and error handling
- Implement proper error logging using Sentry or a similar service
- Handle errors at the beginning of functions
- Use early returns for error conditions to avoid deeply nested if statements
- Avoid unnecessary else statements; use if-return pattern instead
- Implement global error boundaries to catch and handle unexpected errors
- Use expo-error-reporter for logging and reporting errors in production
- Prioritize error handling and edge cases in all functions
