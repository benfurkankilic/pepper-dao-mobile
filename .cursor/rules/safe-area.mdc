description: Safe area management for handling device notches and screen insets
globs: **/*.tsx
---

- Use SafeAreaProvider from react-native-safe-area-context to manage safe areas globally in your app
- Wrap top-level components with SafeAreaView to handle notches, status bars, and other screen insets on both iOS and Android
- Use SafeAreaScrollView for scrollable content to ensure it respects safe area boundaries
- Avoid hardcoding padding or margins for safe areas; rely on SafeAreaView and context hooks
