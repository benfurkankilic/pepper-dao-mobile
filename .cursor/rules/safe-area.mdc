## Safe Area Management

- Wrap the app with `SafeAreaProvider` (react-native-safe-area-context).
- Wrap top-level screens with `SafeAreaView` to handle notches, status bars, and insets.
- Use a `SafeAreaScrollView` (or wrapper) for scrollable content; ensure insets are respected.
- Avoid hardcoding padding/margins for safe areas; rely on provider and hooks.
