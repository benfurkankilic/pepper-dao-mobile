- Write concise, technical TypeScript code with accurate examples
- Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes
- Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError)
- Structure files in this order: exported component, subcomponents, helpers, static content, types
- Follow Expo's official documentation for project setup and configuration: https://docs.expo.dev/
