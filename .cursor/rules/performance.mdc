## Performance Optimization

- Minimize `useState`/`useEffect`; prefer Context + reducers for shared state.
- Use Expo SplashScreen/AppLoading for optimized startup; lazy-load non-critical modules.
- Optimize images: prefer WebP (where supported), provide width/height, use `expo-image` with caching.
- Implement code splitting via dynamic `import()` and React Suspense.
- Prevent unnecessary re-renders with `React.memo`, `useMemo`, and `useCallback` where measurable.
- Profile with RN dev tools and Expo debugging features.
