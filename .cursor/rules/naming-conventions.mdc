- Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., components/auth-wizard)
- Favor named exports for components over default exports
- Use PascalCase for component and class names
- Use camelCase for function and variable names
- Use UPPERCASE_SNAKE_CASE for constants
- Namings should be short but meaningful
