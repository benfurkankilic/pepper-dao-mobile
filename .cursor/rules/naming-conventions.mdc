## Naming Conventions

- Directories: lowercase-with-dashes (e.g., components/auth-wizard).
- Files: lowercase-with-dashes; use .tsx for components, .ts for logic.
- Components: PascalCase. Hooks: useCamelCase. Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE.
- Prefer named exports; avoid default exports for components.
